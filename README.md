# みんなの部屋(minnnanoheya)

"みんなの部屋" is a web matching service between companies and students.

## Description

This web application helps both companies which want more name recognition among students and students who want space for their activities for free. 

By registering for this service, companies can post information of rooms they can lend to students with non-monetary exchange terms, such as participation in company briefings. Students can search and apply for posts that suit their needs, and once both sides agree, students can use rooms for free and companies can gain recognition among students with no advertising expenses.
